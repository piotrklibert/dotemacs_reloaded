follow-mode is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in `follow.el'.

(follow-mode &optional ARG)

For more information check the manuals.

Toggle Follow mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Follow mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.

Follow mode is a minor mode that combines windows into one tall
virtual window.  This is accomplished by two main techniques:

* The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow mode.)

* Should the point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
  movement commands.

Follow mode comes to its prime when used on a large screen and two
side-by-side windows are used.  The user can, with the help of Follow
mode, use two full-height windows as though they would have been
one.  Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text,
and being able to use 144 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
mileage may vary).

To split one large window into two side-by-side windows, the commands
`C-w C-v' or `M-x follow-delete-other-windows-and-split' can be used.

Only windows displayed in the same frame follow each other.

This command runs the normal hook `follow-mode-hook'.
