'make-empty-file'

*** Windmove also supports directional window deletion.
The new command 'windmove-delete-default-keybindings' binds default
keys with provided prefix (by default, 'C-x') and modifiers (by default,
'Shift') to the commands that delete the window in the specified
direction.  For example, 'C-x S-down' deletes the window below.
With a prefix arg 'C-u', also kills the buffer in that window.
With 'M-0', deletes the selected window and selects the window
that was in the specified direction.


** Browse-url

*** The function 'browse-url-emacs' can now visit a URL in selected window.
It now treats the optional 2nd argument to mean that the URL should be
shown in the currently selected window.

*** Output format of 'C-h l' ('view-lossage') has changed.
For convenience, 'view-lossage' now displays the last keystrokes
and commands in the same format as the edit buffer of
'edit-last-kbd-macro'.  This makes it possible to copy the lines from
the buffer generated by 'view-lossage' to the "*Edit Macro*" buffer
created by 'edit-last-kbd-macro', and to save the macro by 'C-c C-c'.

---
*** The list of help commands produced by 'C-h C-h' ('help-for-help')
can now be searched via 'C-s'.


*** TAB completion uses the standard completion-at-point rather than pcomplete
Its UI is slightly different but can be customized to behave similarly,
e.g. Pcomplete's default cycling can be obtained with
(setq completion-cycle-threshold 5).
