By default Emacs is a piece of shit editor.
* looks ancient and ugly!
* completely non-standard binding for even simple commands
    - copy/paste
    - undo/redo
    - search
    - even opening files

By default Emacs is a great bare-bones framework for creating editors.
* nice scripting language with byte-compilation and macros
* *HUGE* stdlib with things from reading directories to HTTP server
* everything that Emacs is is exposed to (and changeable) ELisp

Default is not what you should use by default.
* list-packages
* customize

Diving into the depths of Emacs code
* find-library, locate-library
* find-file-at-point
* find-function
* describe-function/variable/key

Drowning in the plugins
* installed plugins

There's a mode for this!

Random:                                     Sublime:
* moving line/region up and down            * otwieranie plikow
* incremental search                        * rectangular editing
* macros                                    * instalacja pluginow
* multiple-cursors/iedit                    * up-down line or region
* narrow to region                          * support for different languages
* shell/eshell                              * szukanie po plikach, w projekcie
* ediff
* calculator
* ielm
* windows + screens + cycle layouts
* dired/wdired
