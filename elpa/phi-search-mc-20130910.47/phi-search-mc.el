;;; Commentary:
;;
;; phi-search-mc.el provides the following interactive commands:
;;
;; * phi-search-mc/mark-here
;; * phi-search-mc/mark-forward
;; * phi-search-mc/mark-backward
;; * phi-search-mc/mark-all
;;
;;   These funcitons serve as great way to add fake cursors at your
;;   desired points using phi-search.
;;
;; * phi-search-from-isearch
;; * phi-search-from-isearch-mc/mark-next
;; * phi-search-from-isearch-mc/mark-previous
;; * phi-search-from-isearch-mc/mark-all
;;
;;   These functions help access phi-search/multiple cursors functions
;;   from within isearch-mode.
;;
;; Suggested key settings are as follows:
;;
;;   (define-key phi-search-mode-map (kbd "C->") 'phi-search-mc/mark-next)
;;   (define-key phi-search-mode-map (kbd "C-<") 'phi-search-mc/mark-previous)
;;   (define-key phi-search-mode-map (kbd "C-. !") 'phi-search-mc/mark-all)
;;
;;   (add-hook 'isearch-mode-hook
;;             (function
;;              (lambda ()
;;                (define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "M-s M-s")     'phi-search-from-isearch)
